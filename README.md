DESCRIOTON :
The OpenWeatherMap API (Application Programming Interface) and visualizes the temperature over time using a graph. It uses the requests library to send a request to the API and retrieve the weather data in JSON format. The script specifies the API key, city (Daund), and country code (IN for India) to form the URL for the request. The data returned by the API includes the temperature at different times, and the script extracts this temperature data along with the corresponding timestamps.
To visualize the data, the libraries uses matplotlib.pyplot to plot a line graph, where the x-axis represents the time (timestamps) and the y-axis represents the temperature in Celsius.The time series forecast API specifcally provides data point at different times .I Ran this code using Visual Studio (VS), a code editor that helps in managing and running Python scripts efficiently. To make the code work, I installed the required libraries, requests for fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and matplotlib for graphing the data. This script is a great example of how to use Python for retrieving and visualizing weather data, and it can easily be adapted for other cities or additional weather parameters if needed.
